# Pyramidal Implementation of the Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker

This implementation of the KLT tracker is based on the methodology outlined in the paper [here](http://robots.stanford.edu/cs223b04/algo_tracking.pdf).

# Algorithm Performance Results

Below, you can observe how the algorithm successfully tracks an object as the camera changes its direction. The tracked point is highlighted with a red circle.
